    <p>Hi! I'm Vikram. Currently a Java Developer in Washington, DC, I graduated with a Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering from the Univerity of Texas at Dallas. You can usually find me organizing or attending a meetup, listening to electronic music or playing Overwatch. I also spend a small amount of time creating drum &amp; bass mixes as a hobby (more about that on the projects page). Feel free to browse around the site and thanks for visiting!</p>
