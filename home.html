		<p>Hi, my name is Vikram and I am currently a Jr. Java Developer in Washington D.C. I recently graduated 
		with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from The University of Texas at Dallas and I also have a 
		Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore. 
		I have dabbled in various disciplines ranging from robotics to 3D animation but found that my true interest lied in
		computers and software development. I am currently most comfortable with web application development using 
		Java, Spring, Hibernate, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript but I also have experience developing for Android 
		and with other languages such as C, C++ and Ruby. Feel free to check out the other sections on this website 
		and once again, thanks for visiting!
